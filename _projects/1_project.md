We publicly release a synthetic dataset of 10k one-year residential electric load curves, with their local temperatures, contracted power and Time-of-Use plans {% cite nabil2025synthetic %}.
This open dataset generated by **conditional latent diffusion** captures the correlation between cold temperature and electric consumption that can be found in certain countries, e.g. in France.

> Dataset available on [Zenodo](https://zenodo.org/records/15232742)
