**Abstract.**
The undergoing energy transition is causing behavioral changes in electricity use, e.g. with self-consumption of local generation, or flexibility services for demand control.
To better understand these changes and the challenges they induce, accessing individual smart meter data is crucial.
Yet this is personal data under the European GDPR.
A widespread use of such data requires thus to create synthetic realistic and privacy-preserving samples.
This paper introduces a new synthetic load curve dataset generated by conditional latent diffusion. Fidelity, utility and privacy of the dataset are thoroughly evaluated, demonstrating its
good quality and thereby supporting its interest for energy modeling applications {% cite nabil2025synthetic %}.

<!-- The code is simple.
Just wrap your images with `<div class="col-sm">` and place them inside `<div class="row">` (read more about the <a href="https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.4/layout/grid/">Bootstrap Grid</a> system).
To make images responsive, add `img-fluid` class to each; for rounded corners and shadows use `rounded` and `z-depth-1` classes.
Here's the code for the last row of images above: -->

<!-- {% raw %}

```html
<div class="row justify-content-sm-center">
  <div class="col-sm-8 mt-3 mt-md-0">
    {% include figure.liquid path="assets/img/6.jpg" title="example image" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
  </div>
  <div class="col-sm-4 mt-3 mt-md-0">
    {% include figure.liquid path="assets/img/11.jpg" title="example image" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
  </div>
</div>
```

{% endraw %} -->
